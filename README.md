# 🧠 NextOS — The AI-Integrated Developer Tool Ecosystem

NextOS is a next-generation platform where **developers upload AI-compatible tools** — enabling **LLMs (like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude)** to discover, understand, and use them autonomously.

Imagine a world where an AI assistant can:
- Analyze your chess.com game using a community tool 🧩  
- Schedule a meeting via a user-built automation 🗓️  
- Generate images, code, or reports by leveraging open developer tools ⚙️  

That’s what **NextOS** makes possible.

## 🌟 Vision

NextOS bridges the gap between **human developers** and **AI systems**.  
It allows developers to publish tools in a standardized way so that LLMs and smart assistants can use them directly — via APIs, prompts, or executable scripts — to perform real-world tasks.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🧱 **Tool Upload System** – Developers can define tool metadata, inputs/outputs, APIs, and capabilities.
- 🧬 **AI-Ready Schema** – Tools are stored in a structured, LLM-friendly format that supports automation frameworks like **LangChain**, **CrewAI**, and **ChatGPT Plugins**.
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** – Users can discover the most relevant tools using AI-based search powered by embeddings.
- 💡 **Framework Integration** – Tools can declare integration guides for AI frameworks and agents.
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Profiles** – Attribute ownership and version control for uploaded tools.
- 🛠️ **Vector Storage (coming soon)** – Efficient retrieval and ranking of tools for LLMs.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|---------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| **Backend** | Next.js API Routes |
| **Database** | MongoDB (Mongoose) + VectorDB Integration |
| **Embeddings** | Gemini API (or OpenAI Embeddings) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel |
| **Version Control** | GitHub |

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Developers Upload a Tool**
   - Fill out metadata (name, version, author, tags, etc.)
   - Define inputs, outputs, and execution logic (API, script, or prompt)
   - Optionally include integration hints for AI agents

2. **Platform Generates Embeddings**
   - The tool description is converted into embeddings and stored in a vector database.

3. **LLMs or Users Search Tools**
   - AI systems can query the platform to discover the best-suited tool for a given context or task.

4. **AI Executes or References the Tool**
   - The AI uses the provided API or code to complete user tasks autonomously.
